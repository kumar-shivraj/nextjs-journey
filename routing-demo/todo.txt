=============================   scenario 1 : root route("/")    ==================================
*   delete/rename the app directory inside src folder as we are going to create it manually
*   create the app directory inside src folder
*   create page.tsx file inside app folder
*   create a React component named as Home
*   Now, application might have crashed because we deleted the app directory.
    So, stop the application and start again
*   It should reder that Home component at root route("/")

*   Notice  :   layout.tsx was earlier present inside app directory, but we didn't create it now.
                When we first access the root route("/"), this layout.tsx is automatically created.
